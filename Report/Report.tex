\chapter{Introduction}

In this project, we were asked to refactor (flawed) three-tier architecture that implements a web portal applicaton which allows to store and retreive informations about books, articles, etc... Moreover, we needed to identify the different flaws of
this architecture.\\
More precisely, we had to refactor the database layer in order to be able to easily insert a new format of database. The details of this new implementation will be detailed in the first section. Next, we will give the flaws that we found in the architecture.

\chapter{Refactoring}

For this project, we had to refactor the database layer in order to add a new database based on \textit{CSV} files. The original implementation didn't allow us to easily add this new layer and that is where the refactoring is done.
\newline
First, we needed to change some names to make them more precise: \textit{RawDatabase} became \textit{RawDataseSQL}, \textit{UserDatabase} \textit{UserDatabaseSQL}, \textit{RegularDatabase} \textit{RegularDatabaseSQL} and finally \textit{Database} \textit{DatabaseSQL}. 
\newline
In a second time, we added a new level of abstraction with some interfaces that are implemented by the SQL components inherit: \textit{RawDatabase}, \textit{UserDatabase}, \textit{RegularDatabase}.  We also created a new abstract 
class Database from which DatabaseSQL inherits. With this generic interfaces and the abstract class, it became much easier to add a new kind of database.
\newline
Finally, we created the \textit{CSV} database with some new classes \textit{RawDatabaseCSV}, \textit{UserDatabaseCSV} and \textit{RegularDatabase} that implement the corresponding interfaces and \textit{DatabaseCSV} inheriting from \textit{Database}.
\newline
All these classes have been reorganized in the new packages \textit{db.flatfile} and \textit{db.sql}.

As we can see with this new architecture, it is much easier to add a new kind of database.

Some others changes needed to be done in order to have a working implementation:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We added a new line in the file web\_portal.cfg to specify the format of the database.
 \item The constructor of the class \textit{ApplicationFacade} has been modified to take the format into account.
 \item The constructor of the class \textit{DatabaseFacade} has been modified in the same way and now build the database accordingly.
 \item In order to store the user profiles into the database, a new method \textit{asCSV} has been added in the classes \textit{UserProfile} and children.
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Design flaws}

When we refactored the database layer, we found that the database needed to ask the \textit{UserProfile} to give its information in a format that it was possible to store (\textit{asSQL} and \textit{asCSV} methods). It clearly introduce some coupling that could be
avoided if the database could ask the \textit{UserProfile} to give a generic format of itself. Then, it would be the job of the database to convert it into \textit{SQL} or \textit{CSV} in order to store it.
